# Things I notice that need to be done eventually  
- [ ] Add images for homepage; products and categories 1-4  
- [ ] Console says there isn't a request for product 4, add an image call for that  
- [ ] Build static pages for the navigation to actually go to  
- [ ] The footer is full of pages that don't exist, make them exist  
- [ ] The cart button goes to a checkout button pop that doesn't work, make it work  
- [ ] There is no way to get to cart or checkout from home, fix that somehow
