# Things I notice that need to be done eventually  
- [x] Add images for homepage; products and categories 1-4  
- [x] Console says there isn't a request for product 4, add an image call for that  
- [x] Build static pages for the navigation to actually go to  
- [x] The footer is full of pages that don't exist, make them exist  
- [ ] The cart button goes to a checkout button pop that doesn't work, make it work  
- [ ] There is no way to get to cart or checkout from home, fix that somehow  
- [ ] Clean up javascript files, those comments bug me

## New issues  
- [x] It appears the cart logic doesn't recognize smart watch. Check on that.  
- [ ] When you X out of on of the items in cart, while on index.html, it doesn't show any more additions. Might have to rebuild the logic a bit. Further notes are;  
    - Needs refresh to live update.  
    - Removing items breaks all kinds of logic.  
    - Needs styling and number formatting. Dollar signs at least.  
- [ ]Make the categories page have four sections labeled by id so that the index.html categories section has places to go.
